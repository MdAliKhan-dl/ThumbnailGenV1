# 🎯 Conditional GAN for MrBeast Thumbnails

Hey! 👋  
I'm a **young learner diving into deep learning**, and this is one of my first serious projects! I'm building a **Conditional GAN (cGAN)** that generates YouTube thumbnails based on **video titles**, inspired by MrBeast’s videos 🎥💰.

Right now, the code works... kind of 😅 — but there's **so much room for improvement**, and I’d love your help!

## 🚧 What This Project Does

This project takes:
- **Video titles** (like "I gave $100,000 to a homeless person") 📝
- Converts them into **Bag-of-Words (BoW) vectors** 💬
- And generates a **64x64 thumbnail image** conditioned on that title 🧠🎨

Using:
- PyTorch
- The `daspartho/mrbeast-thumbnails` HuggingFace dataset
- A simple Conditional GAN (cGAN) setup

## 🧠 Why I Made This

I'm still learning deep learning, PyTorch, and GANs — and thought this would be a **fun and visual way to learn**.  
But I know it's far from perfect. That’s where you come in!

## 🙏 How You Can Help

If you know more than I do (and I bet you do 😅), you could help by:

- 🔧 **Fixing bugs** — anything broken, please help me patch it!
- 💡 **Improving model architecture** — better Generator/Discriminator suggestions?
- 🧪 **Testing the training loop** — spotting issues with stability, overfitting, etc.
- 🚀 **Optimizing performance** — training is kinda slow, maybe it can be faster?
- 📦 **Refactoring the code** — organizing things better for readability
